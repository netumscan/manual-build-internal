# Working Mode
In the working area outside the range of the 2.4G receiver or Bluetooth signal, you can activate the storage mode of the scanner by following the steps described below. In this mode, all scanned data will be stored directly in the scanner. Before uploading the data, it will be permanently saved in the scanner so that you can upload the data when the scanner is in the receiving signal range.
