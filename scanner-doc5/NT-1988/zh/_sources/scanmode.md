## Auto Sensing Mode
In the auto sensing mode, the scanner will detect the brightness of the surrounding environment. When the brightness changes, the scan is triggered. The scan ends when the scan is successful or the scan time exceeds the single working time. Regardless of whether the last scan was successful or failed, the brightness of the surrounding environment will be detected again.
